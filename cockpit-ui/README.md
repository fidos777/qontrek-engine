## 🎯 Gate 0 – Lead Qualification (G19.4)

The Gate 0 dashboard helps sales teams manage and qualify inbound leads effectively.

### Features

**Route:** `/gates/g0`

**3 Lead Panels:**
1. **Hot Leads** – High-priority leads (score ≥ 80) requiring immediate action  
2. **Warm Leads** – Qualified leads (score 60–79) ready for follow-up  
3. **Cold Leads** – Initial contacts (score < 60) for nurturing  

**Summary KPIs:**
- Total Leads  
- Conversion Rate  
- Average Response Time  
- Qualified Rate  

**Recent Activity Table:**
- Company & Contact information  
- Lead status with color-coded badges  
- Lead score  
- Source (Website, LinkedIn, Referral, etc.)  
- Response time metrics  
- Last contact timestamp  

**Technical Implementation:**
- 3-panel layout with color-coded status indicators (Red/Yellow/Blue)  
- Lead scoring and classification system  
- Responsive grid layout (stacks on mobile, 3 columns on desktop)  
- Accessible markup with aria-labels for panel navigation  
- Table headers with scope="col" attributes  
- Same dev-only fixture fallback pattern as other gates  

**Endpoint:** `/api/gates/g0/summary` → Returns `G0Response (BaseEnvelope<G0Payload>)`

**Tests:**
- Mapping contract tests (envelope + structure)  
- Fixture contract tests (type validation)  
✅ 6/6 tests passing  

**Expected Telemetry:**
```json
{"event":"proof_load","rel":"g0_dashboard_v19.1.json","source":"real","timestamp":"2025-10-21T12:00:00.000Z"}
